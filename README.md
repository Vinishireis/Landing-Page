A landing page with swipe functionality is a web page designed to provide a seamless and engaging user experience through the incorporation of swipe gestures for navigation. This feature is particularly prevalent in mobile-friendly designs, where users can swipe horizontally to transition between different sections or content on the page.

To implement a landing page with swipe, developers typically use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure defines the different sections or content blocks of the landing page, while CSS is employed to style and layout these sections. JavaScript is then used to handle user interactions, detect swipe gestures, and trigger transitions between sections.
